# Testing of Webserver Using Vagrant and Oracle Virtual box
Step by Step Demonstration Live
Step 1: Downloaded and Install vagrant on my PC Link at https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
Step 2: Download Oracle Virtual Box from the Link at https://www.virtualbox.org/
Step 3: Created a New virtual machine by using these two simple commands
       - mkdir test-install-vagrantweb
       - cd test-install-vagrantweb
        -vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
        
        C:\Users\Harshil\test-install-vagrantweb>vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
           A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
           ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
           the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`          vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
